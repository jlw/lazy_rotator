# LazyRotator

Tie log (or other file) rotation to the (un-scheduled?) execution of code. The raison d'Ã©tre for this gem is that I'm too lazy to clear out test and development logs manually and am too anal-retentive to be happy with large log files accumulating in my various project directories.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'lazy_rotator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lazy_rotator
